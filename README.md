<h1>Simple Arithmetic Calculator</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>This C++ program is a simple arithmetic calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can input two numbers and choose the desired operation.</p>

<h2>How to Use:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Input the first number.</li>
    <li>Input the second number.</li>
    <li>Choose the desired operation.</li>
    <li>Enjoy the result!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Available Operations:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Addition (+)</li>
    <li>Subtraction (-)</li>
    <li>Multiplication (*)</li>
    <li>Division (/)</li>
    <li>Exit (0)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Error Handling:</h2>
<p>The program checks for division by zero and provides an error message if the user attempts to divide by zero.</p>

<h2>How It Works:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The program defines functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</li>
    <li>It takes user inputs for two numbers and the desired operation.</li>
    <li>Depending on the operation chosen, the program calls the corresponding function and displays the result.</li>
    <li>If the user chooses "Exit," the program ends with a farewell message.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Note:</h2>
